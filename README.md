# 🧠 Face Recognition with CNN on LFW Dataset

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** approach for face recognition using the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset. It's built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, providing a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to real-time predictions.


## 🔍 Overview

> A hands-on deep learning solution that walks through:
> - Loading and preparing real-world face data
> - Designing and training a CNN from scratch
> - Visualizing performance metrics
> - Predicting unseen human faces
